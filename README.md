Project Overview:

The project is focused on weather prediction using historical weather data from Pakistan for the years 2020 to 2024.

1. Data Loading:
The weather data is stored in a CSV file named weather_data_pakistan_2020_2024.csv.
The data includes information on city names, dates, temperatures, weather descriptions, humidity, and wind speed.

2. Data Pre-Processing:
The dataset is cleaned by handling missing values. For example, missing temperature values are replaced with the mean temperature.

3. Analysis and Modeling:
It involve exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends.
Predictive modeling techniques, such as time series forecasting or regression analysis, used to predict future weather conditions.
It perform analysis by using 4 models: linear regression, polynomial ridge regression, KNN, K mean clustering

4. Comparison and Graphing:
It compares all models and identify the best suitable model for weather prediction.
Also plot the graphs to visualize their modeling
